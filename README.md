## Reflection

This project was to familiarize myself with the tailwind css framework.

Eventually it will be used as a testing ground for all sorts of different things such as authentication, various plugins and maybe a blog using a CMS.

One of the main challenges was ensuring I didn't fallback into my usual pattern of writing css as tailwind is very different to what I'm used to.
